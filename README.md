### Hey.

Hope you're well - thanks for dropping by.

I'm someone who appreciates fashion, enjoys tennis, likes to exercise, and is looking for her first full-time role as a software engineer. I stumbled into iOS development and enjoyed every second (including all the rough days), and I haven't looked back since. I'm always striving to grow and learn more than I did yesterday.
