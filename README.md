### Hey.

Hope you're well - thanks for dropping by.

I'm just someone who appreciates fashion, enjoys tennis, likes to exercise, and...oh, probably the reason you're here reading this, looking for her first full-time role as a software engineer. I stumbled into iOS development and enjoyed every second (including all the rough days), and I haven't looked back since. I'm always thinking of how to grow and learn more than I did yesterday. 

I'm currently working on the second 90% for my JingPin app, with a goal of submitting it to the app store within 2 weeks.
